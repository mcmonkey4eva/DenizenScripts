DenizenScripts
==============

These were some of my public Denizen scripts from the early days of Denizen - this repo stopped being updated in 2015.

In 2022, in celebration of GitHub now having support for Denizen as a language with highlighting and all, I did the basic critical updates to the files in this repo to make it more or less current.
I haven't tested anything in here after the syntax update and I have no idea whether any of it works, if it does it's definitely not a good way of doing things in the modern world.

Among other things, it matches players by name, expects items to have durability data values, etc. For the record, that's because these things were genuinely valid at the time. Players didn't have UUIDs until MC 1.7.6 in late 2014, and they weren't considered a mandatory proper thing until after a few more years had passed.

If you want to see the snapshot of history that was 2015 Denizen scripting, view the repo from back then: https://github.com/mcmonkey4eva/DenizenScripts/tree/64eb4cd6abb222bc90002c8d637b9133b85e8192

I am belatedly licensing these scripts as MIT, though I wouldn't recommend using them. They were written 2013/2014/2015.
