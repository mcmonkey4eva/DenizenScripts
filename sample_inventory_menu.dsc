# Installation:
# To test this, simple put the script in your folder
# and reload scripts. Do /sampleinvmenu to open the menu.
# Note: You need permission denizen.sampleinvmenu to run the command.
# Note: You need permission denizen.sampleinvmenu.god to use the 'god' item.
# This is meant to be used as a basis for your own inventory menus,
# not used directly.
